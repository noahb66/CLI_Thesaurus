# CLI_Thesaurus

Hello, this is a very simple command line Thesaurus app!

You will need to install the requests and modules for it to work!

pip install requests

pip install bs4

There is no spell check so if you spell it wrong just give it another whirl.

I tried to include one but it made it less precise. Maybe it will get updated in the future :)
